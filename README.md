# Projects 10 & 11: React

### Overview

- In project 10, we created our first React App. It has 4 sections. Header has a logo, a button to open a modal to add clothing cards (non-functioning at this point), a hard coded user name, and a hard coded avatar photo. WeatherCard is responsive, displaying the current temperature in Farenheit for a specific (currently hard coded) location. The background will change depending on time of day and weather. Main starts with text telling the user the current temperature and if it is hot, warm, or cold. Next, it suggests clothing to wear based on the conditions by displaying cards of the suggested clothing with a title. If you click on the cards, a preview modal will open, displaying a larger photo of the clothing with a title and the temperature that clothing is suggested for. Currently, the clothing is a default list stored in constants.js

- In project 11, there were some fun changes. We learned about browser router and how to create an SPA. Now we have main or profile displayed based on which link is used. Clicking on the logo returns the user to main, and clicking on the username brings the user to the profile page. Main is the same as it was in project 10, however profile displays all clothing options, reguardless of the weather conditions. We learned about contexts and then added a toggle switch in Header to change the temperature unit from Farenheit to Celcuis. We learned about a mock server, set it up, and created api.js to interact with it. We added a database file and started pulling our clothing from that.
